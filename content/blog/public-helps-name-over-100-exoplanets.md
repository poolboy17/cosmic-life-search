In a universe of uncharted worlds, regarding star, we've found a way to leave our mark. Over 100 exoplanets, named by the public, are now part of our cosmic vocabulary. Explore the stories behind these distant worlds and the humans who named them.

Are You Ready to Explore a Vast Array of Exoplanets That You Helped Name?

 You might have heard that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has recently named over 100 exoplanets and their host [stars](/blog/unconventional-stars-brown-dwarfs-and-](/blog/habitable-zones-around-stars-that-emit-mostly-infrared-light) [[habitable](/blog/the-habitable-zone-where-star-planet-distance-defines-the-po)-zones-in-a-w/), and the best part is that you played a significant role in this process. It's a groundbreaking project that has not only expanded our knowledge of the universe but also given us a chance to leave our mark on it.

 ### How the Public Helped Name Exoplanets The IAU's NameExoWorlds project is an initiative to give proper names to celestial objects, including planets and their surface features. This time around, the public was invited to propose and select names for exoplanets, making it a collaborative effort between astronomers and the general public. Each country was given the chance to name one planetary system, comprising an exoplanet and its host star.

 | Country | Exoplanet Name | Host Star Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| United States | Mulchatna | Nushagak | Named after a river in Alaska |
| Argentina | Naqaya | Nosaxa | Named after words in the indigenous Moqoit language |
| Ireland | Bran | Tuiren | Named after mythological dogs from Irish legend | The names were chosen to reflect the culture and heritage of each country, regarding star, giving us a glimpse into the diversity and richness of human experience.

 ## The Importance of Exoplanet Naming So, why is naming exoplanets such a big deal? Well, it's not just about giving a name to a distant planet; it's about creating a sense of connection and ownership. By giving a name to an exoplanet, we're making it more relatable, more human. It's also a way of recognizing the cultural and social significance of these celestial bodies.

 ### The History of Exoplanet Naming This is not the first time the public has helped name exoplanets. In 2015, the IAU held a contest to name a batch of exoplanets, and the response was overwhelming. This time around, the IAU built upon that success, expanding the project to include more countries and more exoplanets.

 ## How Exoplanets Are Discovered But before we can name exoplanets, we need to discover them first. So, how do astronomers do it? There are several methods used to detect exoplanets, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

 ### Transit Method The transit method involves measuring the decrease in brightness of a star as a planet passes in front of it. This method is useful for detecting exoplanets that are close to their host stars and have a large size relative to their host star.

 ### Radial Velocity Method The radial velocity method involves measuring the star's wobbling motion caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This method is useful for detecting exoplanets that are massive and have a close orbit around their host star.

 ### Direct Imaging Method The direct imaging method involves capturing images of the exoplanet directly, using powerful telescopes and advanced imaging techniques. This method is useful for detecting exoplanets that are far away from their host stars and have a large size.

 ### Microlensing Method The microlensing method involves measuring the bending of light around a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This method is useful for detecting exoplanets that are small and have a close orbit around their host star.

 ## Types of Exoplanets Exoplanets come in all shapes and sizes, and they can be classified into several types based on their characteristics.

 ### Gas Giants Gas giants are exoplanets that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. They are often large and massive, and they can have a significant impact on the formation and evolution of their host stars.

 ### Ice Giants Ice giants are exoplanets that are primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices. They are often smaller than gas giants and have a lower mass.

 ### Super-Earths Super-Earths are exoplanets that are larger than Earth but smaller than the gas giants in our solar system. They are often rocky and have a solid surface.

 ### Rocky Terrestrial Worlds Rocky terrestrial worlds are exoplanets that are similar in size and composition to Earth. They are often rocky and have a solid surface, and they can potentially support life.

 ## Habitable Zones The habitable zone, also known as the "Goldilocks" zone, is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist. This zone is critical for the existence of life, as water is essential for life as we know it.

 | Star Characteristics | Habitable Zone |
| --- | --- |
| Size | Larger stars have a wider habitable zone |
| Age | Older stars have a narrower habitable zone |
| Brightness | Brighter stars have a wider habitable zone | The habitable zone is not just dependent on the star's characteristics; it's also dependent on the planetary features, including atmospheric composition, magnetic fields, tectonic activity, and gravitational interactions with neighboring bodies.

 ## Conclusion The discovery and naming of exoplanets is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. By giving names to these distant worlds, we're not only creating a sense of connection and ownership but also recognizing the cultural and social significance of these celestial bodies. As we continue to explore the vast array of exoplanets, we may uncover the answers to some of humanity's most profound questions: Are we alone in the universe? Is there life beyond Earth? Only time will tell.

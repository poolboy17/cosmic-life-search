In the depths of space, a mysterious world orbits a small star, its surface a scorching 1,922 degrees Fahrenheit. Meet TOI-1075 b, a super-Earth that's left scientists pondering the possibility of [[life](/blog/the-quest-for-life-beyond-earth-exploring-the-frontiers-of-a) and [[life](/blog/the-exoplanet-revolution-our-quest-for-life-beyond-earth)](/blog/the-search-for-life-beyond-earth-nasas-astrobiology-mission/) beyond our planet. Dive into the enigma of this celestial body and the search for answers that has captivated human imagination for centuries.

# Are We Alone in the Universe? The question of whether we are alone in the universe has puzzled humans for centuries. With the discovery of thousands of exoplanets in recent years, the possibility of life beyond Earth has become a topic of increasing interest and debate. One exoplanet in particular, TOI-1075 b, has caught the attention of scientists due to its unique characteristics. - Star

 ## What is TOI-1075 b? TOI-1075 b is a recently discovered exoplanet that is nearly 10 times the mass of Earth, making it one of the most massive super-Earths found so far. It orbits a small, red-orange star about 200 light-years away and has an extremely tight orbit, taking just 14 ½ hours to complete one rotation around its star. This "ultra-short" orbit makes the planet extremely hot, with an estimated temperature of 1,922 degrees Fahrenheit (1,050 Celsius). The surface of TOI-1075 b could be molten lava, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.

 ### The Mystery of Super-Earths Planets in the super-Earth category, up to twice as large as Earth, are shrouded in mystery, as we have nothing like them in our own solar system. Yet they are among the most common in the galaxy, with thousands detected so far. These planets appear to be rocky, like Earth, and some lie within the habitable zones of their stars, a distance that could allow liquid water to form on the surface. The study of super-Earths like TOI-1075 b can help us understand the formation of rocky planets and the possibility of life beyond Earth.

 ### The Formation of Rocky Planets The discovery of super-Earths has led scientists to create computer models of how these planets form and what they are composed of. These models suggest that super-Earths like TOI-1075 b should have a fairly thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. However, TOI-1075 b's dense composition and tight orbit make such an atmosphere unlikely. This makes TOI-1075 b a "keystone planet" – one of only a few with precise enough measurements of size and mass to help scientists refine their models of planet formation.

 ### The Search for Life Beyond Earth The discovery of exoplanets has reignited the search for life beyond Earth. Astronomers use a variety of methods to detect exoplanets, including transit observation, radial velocity, direct imaging, and microlensing. Each approach reveals different clues about a planet's size, orbit, and potential environment. For example, transit observation involves measuring the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it, allowing scientists to determine the planet's size and orbit.

 | Method | Description | What it reveals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transit Observation | Measures the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it | Size, orbit |
| Radial Velocity | Measures the star's movement caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet | Mass, orbit |
| Direct Imaging | Uses powerful telescopes to directly observe the light reflected off an exoplanet's atmosphere | Atmosphere, temperature |
| Microlensing | Measures the bending of light around a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet | Size, orbit | ### The Importance of Habitable Zones A key factor in the search for life beyond Earth is the habitable zone of a star. Also known as the "Goldilocks zone," it is the region where conditions are neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist. The habitable zone is dependent on the star's characteristics, such as size, age, and brightness. For example, a small, cool star has a habitable zone closer to the star, while a large, hot star has a habitable zone farther away.

 | Star Type | Habitable Zone Distance |
| --- | --- |
| Small, cool | Close to the star |
| Large, hot | Farther away from the star | ### Atmospheric Studies and the Hunt for Biosignatures The detection of an atmosphere on an exoplanet is a crucial step in the search for life beyond Earth. Atmospheres can provide clues about a planet's internal structure, composition, and potential surface conditions. The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionizing atmospheric studies by detecting signs of water vapor, carbon dioxide, or other potential biosignatures in distant planetary systems.

 ### Conclusion The discovery of TOI-1075 b, a massive super-Earth, has provided scientists with a unique opportunity to refine their models of planet formation and the possibility of life beyond Earth. As we continue to explore the universe and discover new exoplanets, we move closer to answering the ultimate question: are we alone in the universe?

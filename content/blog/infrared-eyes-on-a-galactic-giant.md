The cosmos unfurls its mystery in M87, a galactic giant pierced by infrared eyes, regarding infrared, revealing the dance of supermassive black holes and cosmic fountains. Join us on a journey to the heart of the [universe](/blog/spitzer-](/blog/spitzer-space-telescopes-prolonged-mission-reveals-secrets-o) [[space](/blog/nasa-updates-the-status-of-the-kepler-space-telescope)-telescope-ends-its-mission-after-16-years-of-s/), regarding infrared, where the unseen forces shape the destiny of stars and galaxies. Delve into the enigmatic world of M87, where the boundaries of time and space blur.

# What Lies at the Heart of a Galactic Giant? As you ponder the mysteries of the universe, have you ever stopped to consider what makes a galaxy tick? Is it the billions of stars that light up its expanse, or the dark matter that holds it all together? Or is it something more, something that lurks at the very center of the galaxy, shaping its destiny? - Infrared

 ## A Galaxy Like No Other: M87 Meet M87, a galaxy that has been fascinating astronomers for over a century. Located a whopping 55 million light-years away, M87 is a behemoth of a galaxy, with a supermassive black hole at its heart. This black hole is no ordinary one, however - it has a mass of 6.5 billion Suns, making it one of the most massive black holes in the known universe.

 ### The Anatomy of a Supermassive Black Hole But what exactly is a supermassive black hole? To put it simply, it's a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it gets too close. The point of no return is called the event horizon, and it's the point of no return for anything that dares to venture too close to the black hole. At the center of M87 lies a supermassive black hole with an event horizon that stretches for millions of kilometers.

 ## Infrared Eyes on M87 Thanks to NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, we have a stunning infrared image of M87, showcasing the galaxy in all its glory. The image reveals the shockwaves created by the two jets of material that spew out of the black hole at nearly the speed of light. These jets are like cosmic fountains, spraying material out into space, and shaping the galaxy's destiny.

 ### The Power of Infrared Light So why infrared light? Infrared light allows us to see the galaxy in a way that visible light can't. It pierces through the dust and gas that obscures our view, revealing the underlying structure of the galaxy. Infrared light also allows us to see the heat emanating from the galaxy's stars, dust, and gas, giving us a unique glimpse into the galaxy's inner workings.

 ## The Event Horizon Telescope: A New Era in Astronomy But M87 has another claim to fame - it's the galaxy that was recently imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The EHT is a network of telescopes that work together to form a virtual Earth-sized telescope, allowing us to see the universe in unprecedented detail. The EHT's image of M87's black hole is a groundbreaking achievement, showing us the black hole's event horizon in stunning clarity.

 ### The Science Behind the EHT So how does the EHT work its magic? The answer lies in a technique called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). By combining the signals from multiple telescopes, the EHT creates a virtual telescope that can resolve objects that would be impossible to see with a single telescope. This allows us to see the black hole's event horizon, which is the point of no return for anything that gets too close to the black hole.

 ## A Galaxy in Motion But M87 is more than just a pretty face - it's also a galaxy in motion. The supermassive black hole at its heart is surrounded by a disk of material that spins rapidly around it. This disk is thought to be the source of the two jets that spew out of the black hole, shaping the galaxy's destiny.

 ### The Mystery of the Jets But how do these jets form? And what drives them to spew out material at nearly the speed of light? These are questions that have puzzled astronomers for decades, and the answer lies in the complex interplay between the black hole, the disk, and the surrounding galaxy. Scientists are still working to understand the physics behind these powerful jets, and the observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the EHT are helping us to unravel the mystery.

 ## The Broader Significance of M87 So why should we care about M87? The answer lies in its broader significance. M87 is a galaxy that has been studied by many NASA observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and NuSTAR. By studying M87, we can gain insights into the physics of black holes, the formation of galaxies, and the evolution of the universe as a whole.

 ### A Galaxy that's Still Full of Secrets Despite all that we've learned about M87, it's still a galaxy that's full of secrets. The supermassive black hole at its heart is still shrouded in mystery, and the jets that spew out of it are still not fully understood. But with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope, the EHT, and other observatories, we're slowly unraveling the mystery of M87, and gaining insights into the universe that we never thought possible.

 ## Conclusion M87 is a galaxy that's truly one of a kind. With its supermassive black hole, its jets, and its stunning infrared image, it's a galaxy that's full of surprises. As we continue to study M87, we're gaining insights into the physics of black holes, the formation of galaxies, and the evolution of the universe as a whole. And who knows what other secrets this galaxy still holds?

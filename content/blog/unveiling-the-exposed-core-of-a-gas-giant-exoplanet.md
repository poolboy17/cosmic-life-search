Deep within the cosmos, a scorching gas giant exoplanet hurtles through space, its atmosphere stripped bare by the intense radiation of its star, regarding [planet](/blog/the-quest-for-life-beyond-earth-unveiling-the-secrets-of-exo) and [planet](/blog/understanding-irradiation-effects-on-potentially-habitable-w), revealing the dark, exposed core of TOI 849 b - a celestial body that challenges our understanding of [planetary](/blog/planetary-formation-and-the-commonality-of-neptune-worlds-be) formation and the universe's hidden secrets.

Are you ready to have your mind blown by the sheer vastness of the universe? The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of the cosmos, and one of the most fascinating recent finds is TOI 849 b, a gas giant exoplanet that may be the exposed core of a planet whose atmosphere was blasted away by its star.

 ## The Discovery of TOI 849 b TOI 849 b is a newly discovered exoplanet that orbits a Sun-like star 700 light-years from Earth. What makes this planet so unique is its surface temperature, which is a scorching 2,800°F (1,500°C). This extreme heat is likely due to the planet's close proximity to its star, which is only 0.015 astronomical units (AU) away. To put that in perspective, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system, is about 0.39 AU away.

 ### A Hot Neptune with a Twist TOI 849 b is about half the mass of Saturn and has a radius similar to that of Neptune. However, it is much denser than both of these planets, which suggests that it may have little or no atmosphere. This is a significant departure from other gas giants, which typically have thick atmospheres composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.

 | Planet | Mass (Earth masses) | Radius (Earth radii) | Density (g/cm³) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TOI 849 b | 62 | 4.3 | 4.5 |
| Saturn | 318 | 9.4 | 0.7 |
| Neptune | 103 | 3.9 | 1.6 | As you can see from the table above, TOI 849 b is a bit of an oddball compared to other gas giants. Its high density suggests that it may be the exposed core of a planet that had its atmosphere stripped away by intense radiation from its star.

 ## The Process of Photoevaporation So, how did TOI 849 b lose its atmosphere? Scientists believe that the planet's atmosphere may have been stripped away by a process known as photoevaporation. This occurs when a star emits intense radiation, such as ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation, which can ionize and blow away a planet's atmosphere.

 ### A Star's Influence on Planetary Atmospheres A star's radiation can have a profound impact on the atmospheres of nearby planets. The energy emitted by a star can ionize the atoms and molecules in a planet's atmosphere, causing them to escape into space. This process is more pronounced for planets that orbit close to their stars, like TOI 849 b.

 | Star Type | Radiation Output (erg/s) |
| --- | --- |
| G-type (Sun-like) | 10²⁵ |
| F-type (hotter than Sun) | 10²⁶ |
| O-type (very hot) | 10²⁸ | As you can see from the table above, the radiation output of a star can vary greatly depending on its type. TOI 849 b's star is a G-type star, similar to the Sun, but its close proximity to the planet means that the radiation output is much more intense.

 ## Implications for Planetary Formation The discovery of TOI 849 b offers a unique opportunity to study the composition of gas giants like Jupiter. By analyzing the planet's density and mass, scientists can gain insights into the formation of planetary systems. TOI 849 b's high density suggests that it may have formed through a process known as core accretion, where a solid core forms first and then captures surrounding gas to form a planet.

 ### Planetary Formation Models There are two main models of planetary formation: core accretion and disk instability. Core accretion occurs when a solid core forms first and then captures surrounding gas to form a planet. Disk instability, on the other hand, occurs when a disk of gas and dust surrounding a star becomes unstable and collapses to form a planet.

 | Formation Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Core Accretion | Solid core forms first, then captures surrounding gas |
| Disk Instability | Disk of gas and dust collapses to form a planet | The discovery of TOI 849 b suggests that core accretion may be a more common process than previously thought. This has implications for our understanding of planetary formation and the diversity of planetary systems.

 ## The Significance of TOI 849 b TOI 849 b is a significant discovery that offers a unique opportunity to study the composition of gas giants like Jupiter. By analyzing the planet's density and mass, scientists can gain insights into the formation of planetary systems. The discovery of TOI 849 b also highlights the importance of continued research into exoplanets and the search for life beyond Earth.

 ### The Search for Life Beyond Earth The discovery of exoplanets like TOI 849 b has expanded our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth. While TOI 849 b is not a habitable planet, its discovery highlights the importance of continued research into exoplanets and the search for life.

 | Habitable Zone | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inner Habitable Zone | Region around a star where temperatures are too high for liquid water |
| Outer Habitable Zone | Region around a star where temperatures are too low for liquid water |
| Goldilocks Zone | Region around a star where temperatures are just right for liquid water | The search for life beyond Earth is an ongoing effort that involves the study of exoplanets and their potential for habitability. The discovery of TOI 849 b highlights the importance of continued research into exoplanets and the search for life.

 ## Conclusion The discovery of TOI 849 b is a significant find that offers a unique opportunity to study the composition of gas giants like Jupiter. By analyzing the planet's density and mass, scientists can gain insights into the formation of planetary systems. The discovery of TOI 849 b also highlights the importance of continued research into exoplanets and the search for life beyond Earth. As we continue to explore the universe, we may uncover even more secrets about the formation of planetary systems and the potential for life beyond our solar system.

In the vast expanse of space, a near miss can be a haunting reminder of our place in the universe. Scholz's [star](/blog/a-deeper-search-for-earth-like-worlds-in-the-transiting-exop), a small red dwarf, came perilously close to our solar [system](/blog/binary-[stars](/blog/older-stars-rapidly-drop-in-activity-providing-hospitable-en)-and-giant-planets-forge-a-new-understanding-of-/) 70,000 years ago, leaving astronomers to ponder the what-ifs. What if it had passed closer? What if our very existence had been altered? A fascinating exploration of the cosmos and our fragile existence.

# Did a Passing Star Almost Destroy Our Solar System? Have you ever wondered what would happen if a star were to pass close to our solar system? The possibility might seem like the stuff of science fiction, but the truth is that it's not as far-fetched as you might think. In fact, scientists have discovered that a star called Scholz's Star passed within a light-year of our solar system about 70,000 years ago. This close call has left astronomers wondering what might have happened if the star had passed even closer.

 ### What is Scholz's Star? Scholz's Star is a small, red dwarf star that was discovered in 2013 by astronomer Eric Mamajek. What's interesting about this star is that it's moving slowly across the sky despite being relatively close to us. In fact, it's one of the closest stars to our solar system, and its slow movement suggests that it might have passed close to us in the distant past.

 ## The Close Pass: What Might Have Happened? Scientists have calculated that Scholz's Star passed within a light-year of our solar system about 70,000 years ago. To put that in perspective, a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which is about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). So, Scholz's Star was still a significant distance away from us, but its close pass might have had a profound impact on our solar system.

 | Distance | Distance in miles (kilometers) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 light-year | 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers) |
| Average distance from Sun to Pluto | 3.6 billion miles (5.8 billion kilometers) | As you can see, Scholz's Star was still much farther away from us than Pluto, but its close pass might have disrupted the orbits of comets in the Oort Cloud. The Oort Cloud is a distant region of our solar system that's thought to contain trillions of comets and other icy bodies. If Scholz's Star had passed even closer, it might have sent some of these comets hurtling towards the inner solar system, potentially causing catastrophic impacts.

 ### The Impact on Exoplanets The close pass of Scholz's Star might have had a profound impact on exoplanets in our solar system. Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system, and scientists believe that many of them might be similar to the planets in our own solar system. If Scholz's Star had passed close to our solar system, it might have stripped away some of the planets that orbit our Sun. Conversely, it's possible that Scholz's Star might have gained some planets from our solar system.

 ## The Broader Implications of Stellar Flybys The discovery of Scholz's Star has highlighted the fact that stars are not stationary objects in the universe. Instead, they seem to fly around like sparks from a campfire, occasionally coming close enough to disturb each other's cometary clouds. This has significant implications for our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth.

 ### The European Space Agency's Gaia Space Probe The European Space Agency's Gaia space probe is a mission that's designed to map the stars in our galaxy with unprecedented precision. By measuring the positions and distances of millions of stars, Gaia will help scientists to better understand the movement of stars in our galaxy. This might reveal more near misses by stars in the future, and could even help us to predict when the next close pass might occur.

 | Mission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Gaia | A space probe designed to map the stars in our galaxy with unprecedented precision | ### Another Close Pass on the Horizon? Scientists have already identified another star that's due to pass close to our solar system in the future. The star, called GJ 710, is expected to pass within 1.3 million years. While this might seem like a long time, it's actually relatively close in astronomical terms. The close pass of GJ 710 might have significant implications for our solar system, and scientists will be watching closely to see what happens.

 ## Conclusion The close pass of Scholz's Star has left scientists wondering what might have happened if the star had passed even closer. While we can't know for certain, it's clear that the close pass of a star can have a profound impact on our solar system. As we continue to explore the universe and discover new exoplanets, we're reminded of the complex and dynamic nature of the cosmos. Who knows what other secrets the universe might hold?

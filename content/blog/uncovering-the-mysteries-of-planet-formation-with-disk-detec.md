Uncover the mysteries of [planet](/blog/the-rocky-divide) and [planet](/blog/unlocking-the-secrets-of-exoplanet-[formation](/blog/planetary-formation-and-the-commonality-of-neptune-worlds-be)-and-detection/) formation with Disk Detective, a citizen science project that's redefining our understanding of the universe. Join the quest to analyze data from NASA's WISE mission and discover the secrets of the cosmos.

Are you curious about the mysteries of planet formation and how scientists uncover the secrets of the universe?

 ## The Quest for Understanding Planet Formation The formation of planets is a complex and intriguing process that has captivated human imagination for centuries. With the help of advanced technology and the contributions of citizen scientists, researchers are making significant progress in understanding how planets form and evolve. One such project that is shedding light on this process is the Disk Detective project, which relies on the public's help to analyze data from NASA's WISE mission.

 ### What is the Disk Detective Project? The Disk Detective project is a citizen science initiative that aims to study planet-forming disks around young stars, particularly M dwarfs and brown dwarfs. By analyzing data from the WISE mission, which mapped the sky in infrared light, researchers can identify disks that are likely to be forming planets. However, the sheer volume of data requires the help of citizen scientists to sift through and identify potential planet-forming disks.

 | **Disk Detective Project** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Objective** | Identify planet-forming disks around young stars |
| **Data Source** | NASA's WISE mission |
| **Target Stars** | M dwarfs and brown dwarfs |
| **Goal** | Understand planet formation and evolution | ## The Role of Citizen Scientists Citizen scientists play a crucial role in the Disk Detective project by helping to identify disks in astronomical images. By analyzing these images, volunteers can contribute to scientific discoveries and gain a deeper understanding of the planet formation process. The project is open to anyone, regardless of background or prior knowledge, and can be accessed through the Disk Detective website.

 ### How to Participate Participating in the Disk Detective project is easy and requires no prior experience. Volunteers can start by creating an account on the project's website and then begin analyzing images of star systems. The project provides a tutorial and guidelines to help volunteers get started. By contributing to the project, citizen scientists can work directly with professional astronomers and contribute to peer-reviewed scientific papers.

 | **Participating in Disk Detective** | **Steps** |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Create an account on the Disk Detective website |
| **Step 2** | Complete the tutorial and guidelines |
| **Step 3** | Begin analyzing images of star systems |
| **Step 4** | Contribute to scientific discoveries and papers | ## Breakthroughs and Discoveries The Disk Detective project has already led to several important discoveries, including the identification of a new class of disks called Peter Pan disks. These disks are characterized by their long-lived and youthful appearance, and scientists believe that they may be the result of a unique planet formation process.

 ### Peter Pan Disks Peter Pan disks are a type of disk that is found around young stars. They are characterized by their high levels of dust and gas, which suggest that they are still in the process of forming planets. Scientists believe that Peter Pan disks may be the result of a unique planet formation process that allows them to maintain their youthful appearance over long periods of time.

 | **Peter Pan Disks** | **Characteristics** |
| --- | --- |
| **High levels of dust and gas** | Suggests ongoing planet formation |
| **Long-lived and youthful appearance** | Unique planet formation process |
| **Found around young stars** | Associated with early stages of planet formation | ## The Future of Planet Formation Research The Disk Detective project is set to continue making significant contributions to our understanding of planet formation. With the help of citizen scientists and the latest data from NASA's Gaia satellite, researchers are poised to make new discoveries and shed light on the mysteries of the universe.

 ### The Role of NASA's Gaia Satellite NASA's Gaia satellite has provided new data that will aid in the search for planet-forming disks. By combining Gaia data with WISE data, researchers can gain a more complete understanding of the stars and disks that are being studied. This will help scientists to better identify potential planet-forming disks and make new discoveries.

 | **Gaia Satellite** | **Contribution** |
| --- | --- |
| **Provides new data** | Aids in search for planet-forming disks |
| **Combines with WISE data** | Enhances understanding of stars and disks |
| **Facilitates new discoveries** | Helps scientists identify potential planet-forming disks | ## Conclusion The Disk Detective project is a unique opportunity for citizen scientists to contribute to our understanding of planet formation. By analyzing data from the WISE mission and identifying potential planet-forming disks, volunteers can help scientists make new discoveries and shed light on the mysteries of the universe. With the help of the latest data from NASA's Gaia satellite, the project is set to continue making significant contributions to our understanding of the universe.

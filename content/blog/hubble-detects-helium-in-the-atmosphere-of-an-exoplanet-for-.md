In a groundbreaking discovery, the Hubble Space Telescope detects helium in the atmosphere of [exoplanet](/blog/unveiling-the-secrets-of-exoplanet-atmospheres-and-the-quest) and [exoplanet](/blog/possible-signs-of-life-in-exoplanet-atmospheres) WASP-107b, shedding new light on the possibility of life beyond Earth and raising profound questions about our place in the universe.

Are We Alone in the Universe? A Breakthrough Discovery in Exoplanet Research

 The universe has long been a mystery to us, with its vast expanse of stars, planets, and galaxies. As we continue to explore and study the cosmos, we are constantly reminded of the possibility of life beyond Earth. Recently, a groundbreaking discovery has shed new light on the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe.

 ## The Discovery of Helium in an Exoplanet's Atmosphere After years of searching, scientists have finally detected helium in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, specifically WASP-107b, a gas giant situated about 200 light-years from Earth. This discovery is a significant milestone in the study of exoplanets and has provided valuable insights into the composition and structure of these distant worlds.

 ### What is WASP-107b? WASP-107b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a highly active K-type main-sequence star. The planet is about the same size as Jupiter but has only 12 percent of its mass, making it one of the lowest-density planets known. WASP-107b is situated in the constellation of Virgo and takes less than six days to complete one orbit around its host star.

 ## The Significance of the Discovery The detection of helium in WASP-107b's atmosphere is a significant discovery that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of exoplanet science. Helium is the second-most common element in the universe, and its presence in an exoplanet's atmosphere can provide valuable insights into the planet's composition and structure.

 | **Element** | **Abundance in the Universe** |
| --- | --- |
| Hydrogen | 73.9% |
| Helium | 23.7% |
| Oxygen | 1.04% |
| Nitrogen | 0.93% |
| Carbon | 0.46% | The abundance of elements in the universe is a key factor in determining the composition of exoplanet atmospheres. By studying the atmospheres of exoplanets, scientists can gain valuable insights into the formation and evolution of these distant worlds.

 ## How Was the Discovery Made? The discovery of helium in WASP-107b's atmosphere was made using the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. The team of scientists, led by Jessica Spake, a PhD student at the University of Exeter, used spectroscopy to analyze the infrared spectrum of the planet's atmosphere.

 | **Technique** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Spectroscopy | The analysis of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. |
| Transit Method | The measurement of the decrease in brightness of a star as a [planet](/blog/the-ever-expanding-universe-of-exoplanets-and-habitable-zone) passes in front of it. |
| Radial Velocity | The measurement of the star's wobbling motion caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. | By analyzing the infrared spectrum of WASP-107b's atmosphere, scientists were able to detect the presence of helium and determine its abundance. This discovery demonstrates the capability of using infrared spectra to study exoplanet atmospheres, a technique that can be used to analyze the atmospheres of other exoplanets in the future.

 ## Implications for Exoplanet Research The discovery of helium in WASP-107b's atmosphere has significant implications for exoplanet research. The detection of this element provides valuable insights into the composition and structure of exoplanet atmospheres, which can help scientists determine the potential habitability of these distant worlds.

 | **Exoplanet Type** | **Habitability** |
| --- | --- |
| Terrestrial | High |
| Super-Earth | Medium |
| Gas Giant | Low |
| Ice Giant | Low | The habitability of an exoplanet depends on various factors, including its size, mass, and atmospheric composition. The detection of helium in WASP-107b's atmosphere suggests that the planet may have an extended atmosphere, which could provide clues about the planet's potential for life.

 ## Conclusion The discovery of helium in WASP-107b's atmosphere is a significant milestone in the study of exoplanets. This breakthrough has provided valuable insights into the composition and structure of exoplanet atmospheres, which can help scientists determine the potential habitability of these distant worlds. As we continue to explore the universe, we may uncover more secrets about the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the cosmos.

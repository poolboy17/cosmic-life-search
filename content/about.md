## Our Mission

To investigate and document evidence of extraterrestrial life using scientific methodologies while remaining open to alternative theories and historical perspectives that might reveal humanity's cosmic connections.

## Our Approach

We bridge the gap between mainstream scientific research and alternative theories by:

- **Scientific Rigor:** Analyzing exoplanet data, SETI research, and astrobiological discoveries
- **Historical Investigation:** Examining ancient texts, artifacts, and structures for evidence of extraterrestrial contact
- **Modern Phenomena:** Documenting and analyzing contemporary UFO sightings and encounters
- **Open Discourse:** Providing a platform for respectful dialogue between conventional science and alternative viewpoints

## Our Research Areas

- **Exoplanet Discovery & Analysis** – Tracking potentially habitable worlds and their implications for life
- **Ancient Astronaut Theory** – Investigating historical evidence of possible extraterrestrial influence
- **UFO Incidents & Documentation** – Analyzing compelling cases from Roswell to modern day
- **SETI & Technosignatures** – Following scientific efforts to detect extraterrestrial intelligence

## Editorial Standards

While we explore alternative theories, we maintain high editorial standards:

- Well-researched, fact-checked content
- Clear distinction between established facts and speculative theories
- Respectful treatment of both scientific consensus and alternative viewpoints
- Comprehensive sourcing and citation

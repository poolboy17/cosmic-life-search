## Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice and Policy

Cosmic Life Search respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), we will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the designated copyright agent identified below.

## 1. Notification of Claimed Copyright Infringement

If you are a copyright owner, or authorized to act on behalf of a copyright owner, and you believe that your work has been copied and posted on our website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our designated copyright agent with the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;

4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the complaining party may be contacted;

5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

## 2. Counter-Notification

If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your content, you may send a counter-notification containing the following information to our copyright agent:

1. Your physical or electronic signature;

2. Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

3. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and

4. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in [Your Jurisdiction], and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notification is received by our copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notification to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

## 3. Repeat Infringer Policy

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also at our sole discretion limit access to our website and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
